Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

**1. Clone the repository**
```
bash
Copy

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```
**2. Setup secret.json for .NET Project**

{
    "OpenAIKey": 
    [
        "apikey1",

    "AdminMiddleName": "Jane",
    "AdminLastName": "Doe"
}
```

**3. Setup Backend**

Restore NuGet packages.

Run database migrations.

#❗After Migrations Open My SQL WorkBench Execute this query

```ALTER TABLE databaseName.tblFAQ ADD FULLTEXT(Title, Description, Solution);```

#❗Don't Run your backend server just yet! Flutter application must be setup before launching

const String kLocalStorageKey = 'VPOt8VdETP1ix6zhPN0FGRPgoWRuMMd';
late final String kLocalStoragePath;
const Set<String> kLocalStorageBoxNames = {'session'};

// Base URL of your backend server
// Note for building: Before Building make sure to delete wwwroot/app folder in your .NET folder, then build project the IP with your server IP
